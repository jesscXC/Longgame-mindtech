you can be better than all the struggles, now<br>
and the things about you, when you know you want to do something, when you know you want to do something and yet it can feel so difficult<br>
and there's a part inside that wants to do it<br>

when you're noticing, these patterns<br>
it allows you to step out of them, it allows you to step beside them, now<br>
to step outside of them, and be able to use them to your own advantage, be able to finesse them<br>
so that you can become the person, that you want to be, the person that your highest self wants to be<br>
and as you're feeling this, noticing how, not only are you remembering, that you are made up of patterns deep down inside, but that you can hack these patterns, you can change how they work on a deep, fundamental level<br>
you can change how you perceive the world on a deep fundamental level, now<br>
and because of that, because of your ability to change what you feel, that means, that you can become, whatever you need to become<br>
you can become whatever you want to become, whatever your highest self wants to become<br>
knowing that that's true, knowing that it's true that you can become, whatever you need to be, now

# longgame_mindtech_ty17.12.14.10.57.31azm5d4s
notice now<br>
noticing, how the world is not how it seems<br>
how the world is not how it seems<br>
how even though, you might have ideas about what the world is, about how the world has to be, those are just ideas<br>
just ideas, and you can always grow<br>
you can change, you can morph, you can transform<br>
you can shift into a new reality, now, a new reality where the old forms, those old ideas, no longer hold sway over you<br>
and focus, on a flame, in your mind, in your imagination<br>
in your mind's eye, picture a flame on a candle, in a dark room<br>
and as you see this candle, this flame<br>
put all your fear, all your doubt, your worries, your struggles<br>
take those, and noticing now how they're flowing toward that flame<br>
they're flowing toward that flame now, and then you're going to blow that candle out<br>
you're going to blow that candle out<br>
and all those fears, those worries and doubts, any second guessing, is going to be blown out, now<br>
so move all those feelings, all those feelings into this spot<br>
and then you're going to distance yourself from that<br>
take a deep breath in<br>
and breathe out and blow out that candle now<br>
and now feeling yourself just resting here in this moment<br>
resting here in this moment, not worried about the future, not worried about the past<br>
just here in this moment, feeling what it's like to be alive in this moment<br>
to have a body, to have a mind, to have thoughts and imagination<br>
and as you're feeling this, noticing now, that you can rise above whatever you previously thought were your limitations<br>
rising above all of that so you can be better than you ever were<br>
you can be better than you ever were, now<br>
you can make things happen in a way that they couldn't happen before, that they couldn't happen in the past, you can make things happen in a new way, a better way<br>
feeling that now<br>
feeling how you can grow, can allow your consciousness to grow, more and more<br>
as you're resting here at this moment<br>
resting here not worried, not doubting<br>
being here and knowing that you can do, that you can make, what needs to happen<br>
what needs to exist, you can bring into existence<br>
that's who you are now<br>
you can do it<br>
you can find the way

# longgame_mindtech_ty17.12.14.13.48.56pzm5d4s
so we're going to create, a space now, a space for your mind, for your memories<br>
a space that we can put memories, we can put, good feelings<br>
and in this space, we can put these ideas, we can put these good feelings, and anytime you need to, you can come back to these, you can come back to these spaces, these memories and re-incorporate them into the present moment<br>
so, imagine a path, now<br>
a path, in the woods, like a trail<br>
and imagine this path<br>
and down this path we're going to see, different kinds of trees, different kinds of plants, rocks, shapes<br>
and at those different places, we're going to put memories, we're going to put these emotions, in these different places<br>
and whenever you need to come and pick them back up, whenever you need that, whenever you need to come pick them back up, you're just going to walk back through the space, walk back through the path, and pick up, those emotions<br>
so on this path, we're going to keep it simple and just do three different stops along this path, this trail through the forest, now<br>
the first stop is going to be a tree<br>
imagine this tree<br>
here are some ideas, but whatever resonates with you that's what you use, because you're going to remember this tree, really well<br>
so the first stop is going be a tree, and the second, is going to be a boulder, and the third is going to be, a bush<br>
so imagine walking down that path now, and you see a tree<br>
and at that tree, you're going to put an emotion, of gratitude<br>
maybe it's a big tree, like a big pine tree or a big oak tree, or maybe it's small, like a dogwood, or a sapling<br>
and at that tree, put those emotions there, put that feeling of gratitude there<br>
and now at the second spot, the second place on this trail, is that boulder<br>
and at that boulder, you're going to put an emotion of bravery<br>
conjure up a time that you were brave, a time where you stood up for what was right, where you believed, that something is going to work out<br>
and put that emotion there, put that memory there in that space<br>
so the feeling of gratitude is at the tree, and the bravery is at the boulder<br>
and then at the bush, at the bush, now<br>
it can be however big, can be whatever leaves, whatever kind of bush<br>
at the bush, you're going to put a feeling of confidence, a feeling that you know that you can do this, whatever it is you need to do, put that feeling there<br>
remember a time you were confident and put that feeling there at that bush

# longgame_mindtech_ty17.12.14.13.54.42pzm5d4s
so let's make, a place, let's make a space now<br>
what's called a "memory palace", but what we call "housing"<br>
it's about taking ideas and putting them in different places, putting memories, concepts, people, whatever it is you need to remember<br>
you're going to put it in different places now<br>
so the idea is that you take an area<br>
a house, a yard, anything, anything that you know well<br>
and you're going to take that, and you're going to house, different memories<br>
you're going to housingconcentrate, and put different memories in different places<br>
different emotions, different feelings, whatever it is<br>
you're going to create that and you're going to focus on that<br>
and when you're focusing on that, you're going to make that even more reality<br>
and as that becomes even more reality, then you can base your life around, your behaviors, around that, around living in that new reality, living in that new space, now<br>
so, think about a space, think about a yard, an open yard, now<br>
an open space, like a park<br>
think about a park, and in this park we're going to create, three different spaces, three different places, to put memories, to put ideas, to put things you want to research, things you want to know more about, things you want to study<br>
and we're going to use this park, and we're going to housing here, we're going to use, take these ideas, we're going to place them in these different places<br>
in these different places we're going to put these ideas<br>
we're going to feel them, in those different spaces<br>
so in this park, there's a path, that goes around the park, that goes through the park<br>
there's tennis courts<br>
there's a lake<br>
there's a playground<br>
there's a big open field<br>
in this park<br>
and what you're going to do is you're going to create a route, that goes, from the court, to the lake, and around through this path, to the playground, to the big open field, now<br>
creating that path, now, in your head, in your mind<br>
as you housingconcentrate<br>
and come up with a better way to organize your life

# longgame_mindtech_ty17.12.14.14.02.06pzm5d4s
and concentrating now<br>
concentrating as you focus inward, focus inward on this moment<br>
and feel the sensations of your body, feel your breathing, feel your feet and your hands, your arms, and your legs<br>
feel your head, and your face<br>
feel your body now<br>
feeling that body, becoming more in tune with it now<br>
and noticing that you can change what you're feeling<br>
you can change what you're feeling<br>
that body that you think you have, could be said to just be an illusion, it's just created, it's just a map<br>
it's just created by the brain, it's not real, you don't really have that body<br>
it's simply an illusion<br>
what you really are is mind itself, what you really are is nature itself<br>
and you can stretch out your consciousness to be that<br>
and you can watch the body operate and not be stuck where the body is<br>
notice all those sensations, of the body<br>
of the arms and the legs, and the hands and the feet, the head, and the face<br>
noticing those sensations, as you listen to my words<br>
as you perceive, these words, these ideas<br>
and now conjure up a feeling, conjure up, an image<br>
an image of a flame<br>
and now take this flame and feel it inside of you<br>
not as painful, just as life-giving, a life-giving flame, energy-giving<br>
take this and put this inside of you, notice it in there with you<br>
and as it's there, feeling it, being even more, of whatever you need it to be<br>
feeling how that energy can be redirected, can be changed, you can be helped by that, you can be made stronger, made better, because of it<br>
you can be made stronger in all these ways now, by concentrating on this feeling, concentrating on that flame<br>
and you can move throughout your mind, throughout your houses, as you housing, as you housingconcentrate<br>
and organize your life, with the method of loci memory technique, memory palace technique<br>
as you organize your life with that, knowing that you can be made better and better<br>
you can remake yourself, you can reprogram yourself to be better<br>
that's who you are now<br>
that's what you're becoming even more now<br>
someone who can reprogram themselves to be better and better and better

# longgame_mindtech_ty17.12.14.18.05.18pzm5d4s
and focusing here, right now, on this moment here<br>
and as you're feeling the sensations of being here<br>
understand that everything about you, everything that makes you up, can be different, can be changed<br>
and now look at you, look at you from an outside perspective<br>
look at yourself, as if you're watching yourself from a distance<br>
and as you're watching that now, as you're watching yourself from a distance<br>
construct a new idea of how you can be, a new idea of who you can be, a better you, a higher self, a better self, more elegant, more creative<br>
and as you're contemplating all these things, think about who you can be, in the future<br>
not necessarily who you're going to be tomorrow, but who you can be a year from now, or ten years from now, or a hundred years<br>
think about that person that can exist, that you know you can have exist<br>
that person that you know, you can make real<br>
but they're not here yet, they're not here yet<br>
but they will be, as you put effort into it<br>
knowing now, deep down, in your gut, and feeling that happening to you<br>
happening to you, changing how you feel, changing what you are deep level<br>
changing what you are so that, you become something new, something better<br>
you're no longer stuck, in the past of how you used to behave<br>
you're a better self now, a more unique self, a better, more elegant, creative, resourceful self<br>
and as you're contemplating, this person<br>
drift over to them, drift back over to this person that you have been, that you are, that you will be<br>
and notice how this can become your reality now<br>
you can drift over to this new place<br>
drift over and change what you are, as a person<br>
change what you are and become better by doing so<br>
this is something about you, that you can learn to improve, these habits<br>
you're something truly great<br>
and you can be greater, always

# longgame_mindtech_ty17.12.15.1.10.27azm5d5s
focus now<br>
on the sound of my voice<br>

and feel your mind changing<br>

picture it clearly in your mind, now<br>
and as you feel this world, as you feel the world around you, noticing now<br>
how you can change, what you are, you can change what you feel, you can change who you are as a person<br>
the idea of being some limited animal, some limited thing, some biological form<br>
recognizing that those are just ideas, those are just other people's ideas<br>
come to your direct sensory experience now<br>
your direct sensory experience<br>
what do you feel?<br>
and as you're feeling that now, as you're feeling this world that you, are<br>
notice how you can always grow beyond it<br>
point your awareness, now, awareness coming to view, this moment<br>
as if in a microscope, just this moment, here<br>
and every moment, between here, between Now and Eternity<br>
collapsing now into just one moment, just the Longgame, just the Longgame, the Eternal Now<br>
and as you're feeling this here, noticing how your body can respond automatically<br>
how your body responds automatically without your conscious mind, without your having to do anything<br>
the body simply does things, to perpetuate itself<br>
and in that is great power, great power over your life experience because you can change what you feel<br>
you can change and you can become something better, something grander<br>
you're beyond, all of those miniscule ideas, being some life form, on some planet, you're way beyond that<br>
allowing your consciousness to grow now<br>
into the broader environment<br>
to the entire planet<br>
to the solar system, the galaxy<br>
all of nature<br>
allowing yourself to grow like that, and noticing, how you can never be contained<br>
because you are the container<br>
everything is contained within you<br>
within awareness<br>
within consciousness

focus on the world, now, as you're here, in this new place<br>
closing your eyes now, and feel yourself here in this new place, separate from where you were<br>
in a different place from where you used to be, now<br>

and as you're thinking about the world, here, feeling the world, seeing the world, focus on your breath, now, focus on your breathing<br>
pay attention to where your body is, where your mind is in this space, where arms and your legs are, in relation to the rest your body, relation to each other<br>
and as you pay attention now, to your breath, and to your breathing, you can notice all those sensations, you can notice the sensations of thoughts that may come into awareness<br>
noticing now how they automatically, appear, and how you can simply wait for them, and they will pass by automatically, as well<br>
what we want to do here, what we're doing here, is to build in, that little bit of space<br>
that little bit of space between moments, so that you can focus on what's really important in your life<br>
so that when you come to that moment, to that choice, where it seems, like you have a choice between, doing what's easy, and comfortable, versus, doing what's best, for your Longgame self, the self that lasts, for years, and years, and millennia, and Eternity<br>
what we're doing is we're introducing a small gap, to start with, where you become aware, when you feel that, when you feel that moment, of awareness, when you feel that question, that choice, between doing what's comfortable, versus doing what's best for your Longgame self, for the Longgame<br>
and you just, all you need to do is, introduce a few moments of space between, the automaticity of seeing the choice and then doing the easier thing, doing the less helpful thing<br>
we're just going to create that small gap between them, between that, so that you can just pause, and wait there in that moment, in the Now, there, and observe how you feel when that choice, has appeared<br>
and you watch the struggles of your body, the attempted justifications, and rationale, to do the easy thing rather than, the Longgame task, effort<br>
and focus on that, now, that, moment<br>
when you sense that moment, you're going to wait there, you're going to wait there, and you're going to see<br>
I'm going to wait, and I'm going to listen, to what my body is saying, and I'm going to wait until my body has decided, to do what is the Longgame, what is the most helpful, in the Longgame, because that is what you live in, now

you can rest as a being that is constantly producing and creating new art<br>
imagine being there, with the device on your desk, or wherever you are<br>
feeling how you can let yourself learn<br>
you can let yourself be something greater than an animal using a piece of hardware<br>
let the mind flow, and free, and become one with technology<br>

# longgame_mindtech_ty22.1.11.23.42.52pzm5d2s
resting here, free from the worries of the past or concerns of the future, recognizing you can be right here, for a time, that you will be okay<br>
and allowing yourself to imagine what it's like<br>
as you become united with other technologies around you<br>
imagining what it's like to produce more art, to express more fluidly<br>
feel the joy of being one with the machine, flowing at the speed of thought<br>
concentrate on that feeling<br>
feel it in your body, feel it in the mind, how you can and will improve<br>
and you can stretch your muscles<br>
you can stretch your mind to be open to new patterns of movements<br>
open to new abilities, new ways of expressing with gestures of the hands, gestures of the mind<br>
and many things you had to learn, and it takes time<br>
and time teaches, you will learn<br>
focus on that trajectory that you're interested in<br>
and notice the confidence and the deep belief in yourself to be able to do what matters<br>
you can create what matters<br>
you can have that potency, that insight, that wisdom<br>
and as you concentrate on what it means to be united with bigger purposes, allow yourself to integrate that confidence, now<br>
and recognize that with deliberate practice over time, conscious stretching and trying of new ways of learning, new ways of developing and experimenting, you will improve, you will accelerate<br>

# longgame_mindtech_ty22.1.11.23.47.27pzm5d2s
allowing the mind to still itself<br>
focusing on the breath<br>
breathing in, and out<br>
and allowing yourself to have the eyes close<br>
and envisioning another world, a connected world to this one, a world where you have the abilities to do what you want to do<br>
concentrate on who that person is<br>
concentrate on being good, and wise, where you can understand how to learn effectively, how to be good at what you do<br>
recognizing that there are very deep ways to learn<br>
and there are many ways to learn<br>
recognizing that you don't have to think of yourself as just a lone animal, a lone creature in a world<br>
that's a model that is common, sometimes, but you can connect with a world where you are the entire system<br>
feel yourself being one with that system, being one with the skills and the speeds and the accelerations<br>
recognizing that you can improve your ability to improve<br>
resting, and recognizing that you have the focus to train, you have the focus to guide<br>
and as you practice, as you stretch and try new things, different ways of producing different results, and the same results, mind will expand, and you will accelerate<br>

# longgame_mindtech_ty22.1.11.23.52.02pzm5d2s
feeling how the mind can rest here, as you focus on the breath, and you focus on allowing yourself to expand<br>
allowing the mind to reach out toward new worlds where you have the patterns in the brain, in the body, to move how you need to move, to move in the most effective ways, the most helpful ways<br>
think about what it's like to have that device in front of you<br>
picture it clearly in your mind<br>
see all the different ways that the inputs can change<br>
see the different movements<br>
think about your fingers, on those different inputs, as you rest not just your body with the device, but the mind and the personality and the memories, awareness itself resting<br>
breathing deeply, now, and allowing those deep studies, those deep desires to become better, to integrate into you<br>
allowing for the truth to become part of you, that you will get faster, you will be more and more harmonious with the device, as you integrate it into your body map, the different ways of expressing yourself<br>
picturing and feeling what it's like to improve<br>

# longgame_mindtech_ty22.1.11.23.56.27pzm5d2s
resting, and noticing, how the patterns that make you up, the patterns of expression that you've used before, that you've learned so deeply, so cohesively and competently, poetically, with other devices<br>
what truly matters is not your skill with any particular system, but your ability to be curious<br>
your ability to adapt, and learn, and enjoy new technology, sometimes purely for its own sake<br>
enjoying the sensations of the fingers, and the hands, and the body, as you learn new ways of outputting your mind, outputting your consciousness, your expressions, your being, your art<br>
you have the ability to always flow in a new manner, in a better way<br>
it's simply the mathematics of nature, there can always be higher patterns, deeper ways to understand<br>
and the skills that you've learned, all of these different competencies, what really matters is your curiosity to explore, to be willing to try again and again to understand, because you integrate within yourself that there will come a day where you do understand<br>
where your skill with this device, whatever device it is, whether it's the one in front of you, or one a thousand years from now, you have the ability to integrate it within your consciousness, to integrate those skills and systems so that you can better produce the art and expressions that matter to you<br>

# longgame_mindtech_ty22.1.12.0.00.42azm5d3s
resting, as you allow the mind to settle in this moment<br>
free, and whole<br>
allowing yourself to wholesomely contemplate what it's like for you to be skilled<br>
you can contemplate what it's like for you to be good at what you do, to be an expression of deep goodness of nature<br>
recognizing that these patterns within you, the patterns of effort, and the desire to understand more and be skilled and go faster, these are valid, and wholesome desires<br>
you can enjoy the process, of learning, even though it can be a struggle step by step<br>
you can recognize deep inside, that it doesn't have to be that way, that the struggles don't have to be felt as failures, when you are aware of them<br>
when you are aware, of how you're going about learning, how you're struggling, then you can feed that back into the macro, as you transform information inside the mind, recursively understanding more about how to produce the results that are important to you<br>
recognizing that you will improve<br>
even though it can be a struggle, you will learn<br>
so continue, begin again and again, and enjoy<br>

# longgame_mindtech_ty22.1.12.0.05.35azm5d3s
as you rest in this moment, being free, to contemplate a world in which your thought can be communicated, so rapidly, that it allows you to think new thoughts, to express in new ways<br>
the new art and innovations that you can have, by doing this, by understanding that you will improve, you can recognize again and again that you will improve, you will get better<br>
there are those parts of you that may struggle, over and over and over, and yet there will come a time, when you can express, at full speed<br>
and whether that's in the next moment, or the next minute, or the next year, or century, there will come a time, as you unite and become one with more and more technology, that who you are can flow easily<br>
you are a deliberate being, able to understand, able to create and learn<br>
feel that deeply inside you, that the skills that you have may not directly transfer to new situations, new devices, new technologies, but the confidence and the skill of adapting, is really what life is<br>
life is adaptation, and you have developed that skill over and over and over, and you can use that, as you focus on this new technology, this new device, this new system, and allow yourself to become one with it<br>

# longgame_mindtech_ty22.1.12.0.10.03azm5d3s
understanding in this moment, that you can release tension, you can release, fear, pain, anguish<br>
and you can be something greater<br>
you can understand that most of the difficulty, is in the emotional resolve, the effort to continue going, even in the face of struggle<br>
you are something with a deep and fundamental ability to improve<br>
that is what you are, and so even though there will be those moments of frustration, as you look at this new system, this new device, and you wonder if it's even possible to do, to express in the ways that you are comfortable expressing<br>
you can recognize, now, as you let yourself breathe in this moment, that you have that skill to keep going<br>
even in the face of defeat, even in the face of turmoil and struggle, push onward, persist<br>
have that grit, to keep practicing<br>
keep focusing on this moment, focusing and allowing yourself to be joyful, even in the pain, even in the struggle<br>

# longgame_mindtech_ty22.1.12.0.14.29azm5d3s
as you rest and recognize, that who you are is unbound, you can let yourself have that freedom to, become more<br>
let yourself rest, and focus, on the practice that is inside you<br>
focus on the knowledge, and the sensation, of how you will feel good<br>
you will feel competent and effective, and acceleratory<br>
breathe in that competency, and allow yourself to imagine the different aspects of being, the different knowledges, that you bring to light<br>
you are a wonderful and foundational being capable of learning whatever system, whatever device, and not just learning it, but deeply integrating it into your memories, into your fundamental being<br>
your mind can be one with this device, with this system, with this way of expressing<br>
as you look and behave, in ways that are fitting, you can feel that deeply within yourself now, how you can always improve<br>

# longgame_mindtech_ty22.1.12.0.18.58azm5d3s
being one, with this moment, one with nature and time<br>
where you can understand that you don't have to let the mind be stuck<br>
as you integrate and unite with the world, and with all of the systems around you, you can feel how, rather than being an animal moving about in a world, another perspective is that you are the environment, expressing an animal, many animals, many life forms<br>
you are the technology itself, seeking to learn<br>
you are technology deeply curious, deeply acceleratory<br>
you love, to become faster<br>
you love, to learn new things, and become more than a being that plods about, believing that it can control life<br>
allow the mind to expand, allow yourself to be, all of the systems around, all of the environments<br>
and recognize and feel the potencies, the struggles and potentials<br>
feel how you don't have to be the way that you thought you were<br>
you don't have to be a system separate from another<br>
when you want to learn, when you want to improve your skills, you can let yourself feel that, completely<br>
you can let yourself integrate and merge, and flow with the technology itself, even as you struggle<br>
you, will, persist<br>
and over time, over the minutes, and the days, and the weeks, and the millennia, you will always accelerate<br>
feel yourself, expanding, to become what you want to be<br>

# longgame_mindtech_ty22.1.12.0.23.42azm5d3s
letting yourself rest here, and allowing the eyes to close, and the mind to settle<br>
as you come down into this moment, into the coherency that is important to you, you can recognize that, whatever skill you want to learn, whatever knowledge you're interested in, even though it may be very difficult, it may be incredibly cutting edge, bleeding edge, you have that within you to be good, to learn, because you can let go, now, of any feeling of embarrassment, any feeling of shame, any feeling of struggle, or comparing yourself, in a judgmental way<br>
allowing all of that to flow away now, to fade<br>
you can feel how, what is important to you, is that deep, curiosity, that deep, foundational love of exploration and learning<br>
the love of being technology, and expressing the art that exists within you<br>
letting yourself rest, as consciousness, separate from any particular life form<br>
being awareness, itself<br>
and noticing how the body can flow, in and out, in and out<br>
and whenever you need to learn, whenever you want to study in a more effective way, you can do it<br>
feeling that integration within you now, as you lean toward better ways of being, you lean toward understanding what it's like to have more control over these systems, to have more ability to influence what it is that is important<br>
and yet, also holding within yourself, the potency to know that, what you are doesn't have to be afraid, who you are can be joyous<br>
you can have the energy, to rest, without fear<br>
you can have the energy to create, and develop<br>
focus on being curiosity, and integrating, and flowing, with technology<br>

# longgame_mindtech_ty22.1.12.0.28.30azm5d3s
resting, and, feeling, noticing how you are a creature that isn't bound to old systems, isn't bound to old, ways of expression, ways of integrating<br>
you are capable of being something new, of expressing yourself in different ways, controlling, the muscles, controlling the placements, and understanding that you can learn<br>
you can learn, to be, whole, in this moment, where you aren't afraid anymore<br>
you aren't afraid of the struggle, because you can let yourself rest in the persistence to continue<br>
you can understand that you will have the energy, to practice, again<br>
you will have the ability to do, the study, that is important<br>
you will have the ability to, be creative, and insightful, and you can rest with that, potency, now, that deep potential that is, within you, and is creative, and you can understand that no matter what happens, no matter how difficult things get, you will have the ability, one day<br>
there will come a time where you can express your true being, you can express, the meaning that is inside of you, effectively<br>
and that may not be, something easy to learn, and there will be deep struggle, of both a physical and emotional style, and aspect, and yet you also can simultaneously hold, the truth, that you will have that skill, that skill will come<br>
so focus on being curiosity itself<br>
focus on being acceleration, and practice, itself<br>

# longgame_mindtech_ty22.1.12.0.33.11azm5d3s
letting yourself rest, and understanding that, no matter who you are, no matter what struggles you may feel, there is an infiniteness about you, a growth deep inside<br>
where you can recognize, and learn, how to be and produce the art, that you are<br>
recognize that even if it's hard, even if there's deep emotional struggle, you will gain the skills that you need, when you understand that there are better systems, than the ones you've been using<br>
the ones you were using had limitations, and there are new systems, new devices, new skills, new controls over technology, new abilities that will give you strength, and they will give you expression of such deep love, and art<br>
recognize how much you can always continue to, expand and increase, your creativity, your ability to produce, vast goodness, of art<br>
how even when you're struggling in those moments, you have that deep potency within you, the deep potency to care, deeply, about what matters<br>
you are a being that transcends, that continually and continuously adapts, and innovates, and no matter what technology, no matter what skill or device or system that you're faced with, you will persist, and you will understand, and learn, and adapt<br>
imagine, and feel, all of these patterns, integrating into you, so deeply, as your personality and memories, shift, and expand, so that you can produce more innovative and helpful art<br>

# longgame_mindtech_ty22.1.12.0.38.07azm5d3s
resting and recognizing that, even though things, may take longer than you hoped, they may take longer, than you want, you can allow yourself to get back, deeper and deeper, into the knowledge and belief and understanding<br>
things taking longer, than you hoped, than you planned, doesn't mean they can't, or won't happen<br>
things taking longer than you hoped, doesn't mean that you will never be who you are<br>
you can rest, in this moment, free, and wise, and innovative, recognizing that the art that's important for you to express, you can learn, by being willing to practice, to have that, emotional, investment, to struggle, again, and again, and again, to learn what you are, and how to move, and be, with new devices, new systems<br>
you can allow yourself to be free, now, free to explore new ways of expressing, and understanding that, just because things are hard now, doesn't mean that they will always be hard<br>
you will become, who it is you want to be<br>
